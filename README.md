This project predicts district-level water scarcity risk using satellite data to support farmers and policymakers. It combines GRACE groundwater levels, MODIS NDVI, and rainfall data to train a machine learning model that outputs a risk score (0â€“1) indicating the likelihood of water scarcity.
The goal is to:
Detect early signs of drought or water stress
Help farmers make informed irrigation and crop decisions
Promote sustainable water resource planning
Output data can be used in dashboards, alerts, or integrated into farmer advisory platforms.
Also the GRACE dataset seems to have some issue within it, so we are currently looking for more such datasets and once we have that we will proceed further with the ML model
